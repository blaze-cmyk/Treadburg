    "analysis": "TRADEBERG: Net long positioning with trapped shorts below $43,200. Price swept PDH at $43,850 and absorbed sell-side liquidity. Imbalance zone at $43,500-$43,650 acting as magnet.\n\nLiquidity Map:\n- External: $44,500 (session high, obvious stops), $42,800 (PDL, retail stops)\n- Internal: $43,500-$43,650 (fair value gap from 08:45 sweep), $43,200 (absorption zone)\n- Session: Asia high $43,750, London low $43,150\n\nPath Likelihood:\n- Path A (Upside continuation): 65% probability\n  Beneficiaries: Late longs entering $43,400-$43,600, market makers who accumulated $43,000-$43,200\n  Victims: Shorts above $43,800, breakout chasers if rejection occurs\n  Thesis: Sweep of $44,500 liquidity pool to fuel next leg, vol compression suggests coiling\n\n- Path B (Range-bound chop): 25% probability\n  Beneficiaries: Range traders, theta sellers\n  Victims: Directional breakout traders on both sides\n  Thesis: Absorption at $43,800 resistance and $43,200 support creates equilibrium\n\n- Path C (Downside flush): 10% probability\n  Beneficiaries: Shorts, liquidity providers who fade the move\n  Victims: Trapped longs $43,400+, stop losses at $43,200\n  Thesis: Requires catalyst (macro shock, derivative unwind) to break structure\n\nTriggers/Invalidations:\n- Bullish trigger: 15m close above $43,850 with volume expansion (confirms sweep completion)\n- Bearish trigger: Break below $43,200 with acceptance (invalidates accumulation thesis)\n- Invalidation: 4h close below $42,800 kills upside scenario entirely\n\nTradeable Set-ups:\n- Entry: $43,450-$43,550 (imbalance fill, limit orders)\n- Stop: $43,150 (below absorption zone, invalidation point)\n- Target 1: $44,200 (session liquidity)\n- Target 2: $44,500 (external pool sweep)\n- Risk/Reward: 2.8:1 (T1), 4.2:1 (T2)\n- Execution: Scale in 40% at $43,500, 60% at $43,450. Trail stop to breakeven at $43,900.\n\nRisk Zones:\n- $43,800-$43,850: Trapped longs from failed breakout, potential resistance\n- $43,200: Stop cluster, likely to be hunted before continuation\n- $44,500+: Retail FOMO zone, expect profit-taking and reversal attempts\n\nDerivative Overlay:\n- Gamma wall likely at $44,000 (round number, options strike)\n- Put/call ratio suggests net long bias, dealer hedging flows supportive\n- Vol regime: Compression (IV rank 15th percentile), expansion expected on breakout\n\nCross-Asset Context:\n- DXY showing weakness (supportive for BTC)\n- Equity futures flat (neutral, no risk-off pressure)\n- Funding rates positive but not extreme (no overleveraged longs yet)",
